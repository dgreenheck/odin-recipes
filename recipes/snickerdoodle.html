    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my grandma's famous snickerdoodle cookie recipe. She used to make these all the time for us when we were kids. They never lasted more than a day!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cookie</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Coating</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.</li>
      <li>Beat 1 1/2 cups white sugar, butter, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together.</li>
      <li>Mix 2 tablespoons white sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Form dough into 2-teaspoon-size balls and roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place dough balls, about 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>

    <p>When removing cookies from the oven, they make look doughy still. By allowing them to continue to cook on the cookie sheet out of the oven prevents hard cookies.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <p>For storing cookies, place cooled cookies in a plastic container or plastic bag with a piece or two of bread to keep cookies soft.</p>
